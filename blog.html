                        <p>What kind of bucket list doesn’t include the Great Pyramids of Giza in Egypt? Believe it or not, the Giza pyramids are fairly easy to visit on a day trip from Cairo, the capital of Egypt.

                            Built in 2560 BC, the Great Pyramid of Giza was the tallest man-made object in the world for 3,800 years. It’s the oldest of the Seven Wonders Of The Ancient World, and the only one still standing today.
                            
                            Visiting the Egypt pyramids is a pretty simple experience, and there’s not a whole lot to do there except gaze at the big piles of rock, but it’s still a profound and unique experience that every traveler should check off their list.

                        <a href="#">Bali Wterfalls</a>
                        <p>Thanks to Bali’s tropical climate and mountains, there are dozens of natural waterfalls to see on the island, and most of the best Bali waterfalls are easy to reach from popular areas like Ubud.

                            Some of the best waterfall hikes in Bali are well known tourist spots, while others are hidden gems with no people. North Bali has many of the top ‘must visit’ waterfalls on the island, but there are also some nice ones in the Ubud area. Either way, all of them are worth seeing!
                            
                            Here’s my complete Bali waterfalls map and guide, with a list of the very best waterfalls in Bali!

                        <p>Believe it or not, many of the best places to visit in Indonesia are still practically unknown to tourists. There are more than 17,000 beautiful Indonesian islands and most of them are still waiting to be traveled.

                            Everyone goes to Bali, which is a wonderful island for vacation (don’t get me wrong), but it’s been suffering from overtourism and overdevelopment for years.
                            
                            If you branch out to the other islands in Indonesia, you can see smoking volcanoes, sulfur lakes, pink sand beaches, tropical rainforests, exotic wildlife, and so much more.
                            
                            Since Indonesia is my second home (and my wife’s actual home!), we’ve been privileged to do a bunch of exploring in this beautiful country, including some of the most far flung Indonesian islands.

                        <p>The Mount Everest Base Camp Trek in Nepal is one of the world’s best bucket list hikes. In less than 2 weeks, you can trek to the foot of Mt Everest and other snowy peaks in the Himalayan mountains.

                            The good news is that it’s not a super difficult hike, and you don’t need a big budget to do it. The EBC trek is worth it for the accomplishment alone, but you also get views of the Himalayas that are out of this world.
                            
                            This guide will explain how you can do the Mt Everest Base Camp hike independently (with or without a tour guide), along with a recommended packing list and everything else you need to know before you go!
